I am trying to build a Game called Connect_Four.
The reason why i want to build it is because i want to see if programing video games is what i want to do in the future.
It will be useful for entertaining people and giving something people can play when bored.

User Manual:

After you start the prgram,
Who ever is Player One goes first with playing the red disc,
You just have to move your mouse over the row you want to put disc in then the disc will drop to the lowest column that doesn't already have a disc.
Then it will be Player Two turn playing with the yellow disc and they just have to do the same.
Until one person has 4 disc in a row and that player wins or it draws.
And then you can do it all over again.

Implementation manual:

This application was created by using java and javafx. This application all that place in one class, ConnectFour.java and along with some background music.
The way the appilaction built the board that the play on is by using Shapes, like rectangular and circles.
With Lighting and light to make it look more nice.
The code uses javafx animation to show that the disc is droping down and MouseClicked to allow the player to click the row that want to drop the disc.
Also uses Alert to bring up an new page whenever one of the players win the game,
and then when the new page shows up I use Button to allow the player to leave the game or restart the gameover.
